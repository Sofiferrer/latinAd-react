## Known Issues / Work in progress

The aesthetic part can and will be improved. In the given time, I focused my attention on the correct functioning and technical implementation of the programming language, the framework and the libraries used. I hope to achieve that wow effect with my code.
The API is private, so the next step is to connect this app to libraries like JWT and Firebase so that it is open to public testing.
In the mid term I will develop the backend myself as part of my training in backend development with Node.js currently underway at Ada ITW.
